# Sentiment_Analysis_NLP

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves the extraction and analysis of subjective information from text data. It aims to determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.

The primary goal of sentiment analysis is to understand and quantify the subjective opinions, attitudes, and emotions expressed by individuals or entities in text data. This can be done at various levels, including document-level sentiment analysis, sentence-level sentiment analysis, or aspect-level sentiment analysis.
